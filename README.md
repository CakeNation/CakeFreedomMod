## NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS NOW DISCONTINUED! THANKS FOR VIEWING THOUGH!

CakeFreedomMod is a CraftBukkit server plugin designed primarily to support the [Official CakeNation Minecraft Server](http://cakenation.xyz/). However, you are more than welcome to adapt the source for your own server.

This plugin was originally coded by StevenLawson (Madgeek1450), with Jerom van der Sar (Prozza) becoming heavily involved in its development some time later, then had commands added to it by xYuchi then some added by CakeNation (jamisen10) and Jacob4294967296 (JacobMathBoy). It consists of over 85 custom coded commands and a large variety of distinguishable features not included in any other plugin. The plugin has since its beginning grown immensely. Together, with the CakeFreedomMod server, CakeFreedomMod has a long-standing reputation of effectiveness whilst maintaining a clear feeling of openness towards the administrators and the players themselves.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in developing CakeFreedomMod. For information on how CakeFreedomMod is licensed, please see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
